# Kuro Chat

A simple chat application with the purpose to improve and practice my programming skills

## Getting Started



## TODO:


### Enhancements
- Paginate chat messages (HIGH) ===> Encountering problems with pagination issue with onChildAdded
- Update Register/Login screen
- Online/offline statuses are not real time
- [channel_list_page][IOS] Allow background color behind notch
- Add smt like DiffUtil to chat list
- Add some animation
- Resolve TODOs
- Pull to refresh add bouncing or smt in channel list page

## Need research
- Get online status only once when enter chat page, to reduce unneeded listen online status
- Queue to debounce send messages to reduce writes
### Bugs
- App bar color 
- [chat_page] When keyboard is open, long press -> show delete bottom sheet -> keyboard cover this
        => Dismiss keyboard on long press chat message
### New features
- Add send images
- Add mentions
- Add notifications
- Add settings screen
- Add search channels
